This process preserves the actual cell structure of the once living dinosaur. \nThis designer cabochon is a premium quality fossil with spectacular red color and a very unusual agate window.  Very fine and rare indeed.\nNOTE:  In order to retain the agate window a portion of the back and girdle is resin filled.  The stone is solid and this can be easily covered with a bezel setting.
